             draft-tschofenig-core-early-data-option-latest

Abstract

   This document defines mechanisms that allow clients to communicate
   with servers about CoAP requests that are sent in early data.
   Techniques are described that use these mechanisms to mitigate the
   risk of replay.

1.  Introduction

   TLS and DTLS 1.3 provide a "zero round-trip time" (0-RTT) feature,
   the mechanics of which are described in Section 2.3 of [TLS13].

   This feature provides a significant performance enhancement by
   enabling a client to send data to a server whom it has already spoken
   to in the first TLS handshake flight.  However, TLS does not provide
   inherent replay protections for 0-RTT data, therefore the application
   running atop the TLS session has to take care of that.  Specifically,
   Appendix E.5 of [TLS13] establishes that:

      Application protocols MUST NOT use 0-RTT data without a profile
      that defines its use.  That profile needs to identify which
      messages or interactions are safe to use with 0-RTT and how to
      handle the situation when the server rejects 0-RTT and falls back
      to 1-RTT.

   This document defines the application profile for CoAP [CoAP] to
   allow clients and servers to exchange CoAP requests that are sent in
   early data.  It also describes how to mitigate the risk of replay.
   The design is inspired by [RFC8470].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  0-RTT Data

   For a given request, the level of tolerance to replay risk is
   specific to the resource it operates upon (and therefore only known
   to the origin server).  In general, if processing a request does not
   have state-changing side effects, the consequences of replay are not
   significant.  The server can choose whether it will process early
   data before the TLS handshake completes.

   It is RECOMMENDED that origin servers allow resources to explicitly
   configure whether early data is appropriate in requests.

   This document specifies the Early-Data option, which indicates that
   the request has been conveyed in early data and that a client
   understands the 4.25 (Too Early) status code.  The semantic follows
   [RFC8470].

   // Note that 4.25 is just the suggested CoAP response code, which has
   // not been registered yet.

4.  Security Considerations

   Background: * Appendix E.5 of [TLS13] * Section 8 of [TLS13] *
   Section 6 of [RFC8470]

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New Option

   IANA is asked to add the Option defined in Table 2 to the CoAP Option
   Numbers registry.

   +========+============+===========+
   | Number | Name       | Reference |
   +========+============+===========+
   | TBD    | Early-Data | RFCthis   |
   +--------+------------+-----------+

        Table 2: Early-Data Option

5.2.  New Response Code

   IANA is asked to add the Response Code defined in Table 3 to the CoAP
   Response Code registry.

   +======+=============+===========+
   | Code | Description | Reference |
   +======+=============+===========+
   | 4.25 | Too Early   | RFCthis   |
   +------+-------------+-----------+
